           <h3> What are My Once Upon A Time reading programs? </h3>
            <div> 
                <p> 
                The very idea of <a href="http://myonceuponatime.in"> myonceuponatime.in </a> Children's library is to help parents to choose right books for their children and delivers them to their doorsteps. We have developed various reading programs for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, early readers and tweens. After you register, you can sign up for these programs based on your child's interest and reading level. 
                     
                </p>
            </div> 
             
            <h3> What are the different membership plans available? </h3>
            <div> 
                <p> 
                    The plans are categorized based on 2 factors:
                    <br> <br> 1. Number of books needed per delivery <br> 
                    2. Duration for which the customer would like to subscribe. Longer the subscription duration of the plan, higher the cost savings.
                </p>
            </div> 
            
              <h3> What is Current Holds List in the patron page?</h3>
            <div> 
                <p> 
                    Current Holds is the list of books you want to read. Browse through the online catalogue and "Add Hold" on all the books you would like to read. When you are ready for your next set of books to be sent out, we will send the first set of available/in-stock books (depending on the number of books in your subscription plan) from your Current Holds queue. 
                    We suggest that you always keep at least 10 books in your Current Holds queue, since books are sent out based on their availability.
                
                
                </p>
             </div>
        
              <h3> How to add books into Current Holds?</h3>
            <div> 
                <p>
                <br>
                    Browse through the lending library catalogue by using the search option or simply scrolling through the entire catalogue which is sorted alphabetically. Click on the books listed to read a description of each book.
                <br>   <br>
                When you see a book you would like to read, click on the 3 dots below the image of the book and select Add Hold. You may also click on the book cover image to read a description of the book and then click on the Add Hold button available there. A pop-up tray opens at the bottom of the screen which is a temporary placeholder for all the books you would like to place on Hold. To remove any books from this list, simply click on the red circle on the top right corner of the book. To clear all the books in the tray, click on Clear Queue. Once you are ready, you can click on Complete to add all the selected books into your Current Holds list.

              <h3> What is Patron Page?</h3>
            <div> 
                <p> 
                    Clicking on the Patron Page will take you to your account overview. Here you can see 3 lists <br> 
                    <br> 1. Current Holds (Books you want to read next)
                    <br> 2. Your Active Items (Books you currently have in hand)
                    <br> 3. Recent Lending History (Books you have checked-out in the past)

                    <br> <br>  There is an option to edit your profile. You can change your personal information and password here.

              <h3> What is the minimum number of books I need to maintain in Current Holds?</h3>
            <div> 
                <p> 
                    We suggest that you always keep at least 10 books in your “Current Holds” list, since books are sent out based on their availability/in-stock status. 

                    <br><br> For example, if you have subscribed to a 3 book plan and you keep only 3 books in your Current Holds list and all 3 books have been checked out by other members, there will be a delay in your delivery. To avoid this, it is best to keep at least 10 books in the list at all times, so that we may send out the first 3 available books from the list without any delay.
