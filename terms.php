              <h2> I. SERVICES </h2>
              
              <p> <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>is an exclusive childrenâ€™s library and provides customers the opportunity to rent books online. Customers can browse the online catalog and add books to hold. Browse through the online catalogue and <strong> "Add Hold" </strong> on all the books you would like to read. When you are ready for your next set of books to be sent out, we will send the first set of available/in-stock books (depending on the number of books in your subscription plan) from your Current Holds queue. We suggest that you always keep at least 10 books in your Current Holds queue, since books are sent out based on their availability.The choice of the plan determines the number of books shipped, frequency of shipment & the rental charges. </p>
 

              <p> When <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> receives a request for delivery, the books are chosen from the Hold Queue subjected to availability. </p>

              <p> Once the customer reads the book & schedules a pickup, the next set of books are chosen from the Hold Queue and sent. Books will be shipped from the Hold Queue depending on the availability of the book. If by order of priority, a certain title is unavailable at the time of shipment, the next available title will be shipped. </p>
              
              <h3> Membership Policy: </h3> 
              
              <p> After becoming a <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>  library member, you are responsible for paying periodic subscription fees according to the then current billing terms. Subscription fees are non-refundable. A onetime refundable deposit (depending on the plan) is also collected to cover incidental loss or damage of the books.  There is no late fee and you can keep the books as long as you wish while your membership is active.</p>

              <h3> Membership Plan Changes: </h3>
              
              <p> A subscriber may upgrade plans at any time. Please contact <a href="contact.php"> admin@myonceuponatime.in </a> for membership plan changes. Pro-rated subscription fee will be calculated for the remaining term and charged to you accordingly. If you wish to downgrade your plan you may do so only after your current plan expires. </p>

              <h3> Billing Policy: </h3>
              
              <p> A subscriber will be billed the subscription fee plus any applicable sales/service tax, at the beginning of each subscription period. All fees and charges related to the subscription plans are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>   library may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email. On cancellation of your membership, and in the event that there are no deductions towards loss of or damage to property, your security deposit will be refunded n whole. </p>
              
              <h3> Cancellation:</h3>
              
              <p> You can cancel your membership at any time. Please send us an email at  <a href="mailto:admin@myonceuponatime.in"> admin@myonceuponatime.in </a> and we will process your request and schedule a pickup. Refund will be processed after deducting the actual cost of damaged/lost books (if any) from the security deposit. You are liable to return the books within 7 business days.Failure to do so within Seven days makes the member liable for the cost of those books for which My Once Upon A Time reserves the right to charge the Member's refundable security deposit. If the cost of the books exceed the security deposit, the customer is liable to pay the balance amount to <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> . <br> <br>  <strong> There will be no refund of Membership and Registration Fees. </strong></p>

              
              <h3> Shipping Policy: </h3> 
              
              <p> <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> manages its logistics in partnership with logistics provider(s). We will try our best to process your order the same day as you place the order (except Sundays and national/regional holidays). Books usually will be delivered within 3-5 working days of placing the order, but this largely depends on the logistics partner. We assume no liability or responsibility for any failures, delays, or interruptions in the shipment of book(s). The books shipped will be governed by the availability of the book in <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> inventory. For the locations where unlimited deliveries are offered, the books will be delivered based on delivery schedule for that location.           
              </p>

              <h3> Hold Queue: </h3> 
              
              <p> <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>  will ship to you the books listed highest in your queue, however when availability is limited, we may ship you books lower on your queue. If you have re-ordered your queue, it may not immediately impact your next shipment provided your shipment was already processed. These re-ordering will, however, impact subsequent shipments.  </p>

              <h3> Book Allocation:</h3>
              
              <p> <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> reserves the right to allocate and ship books among our subscribers in any manner that we deem fit, in our sole and absolute discretion. In addition, My Once Upon A Time will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine the quantity of books we purchase for any particular title and the level of staffing and number of shipments to be processed. As a result, we may not always send you the top choices from your queue, and we may not ship out your next book(s) on the same day that we receive one from you. At present, our goal is to ship you the book(s) listed highest in your queue. Often, on the same day that we pick up a book(s) from you, we will deliver the next available book(s) from your queue. In certain instances, your next available book(s) will not ship until at least one business day following our receipt of your returned book(s).</p>
              
              
              <h3> Book Return: </h3>
              
              <p> <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> reserves the right to request return of any and all book(s) in the possession of Members at any time. Members understand and agree to promptly return any book(s) to <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> on request, and that failure to do so within seven days of the request makes Members liable for the cost of those book(s)  for which <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> reserves the right to charge the Member's refundable security deposit. Customers are requested to inform <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong> by SMS or Whatsapp <strong> (Numbers +91 735-807-4341 or +91 638-249-3117) </strong> when they are ready to return the books they have borrowed and accordingly schedule a pick up. This is a free service provided by <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>, however, in the event that at the scheduled time of delivery/ pick-up, the customer is unavailable, and another pick-up service has to be scheduled, the cost of the courier service will be charged to the customer. </p>
 
              <h3> Book Content:</h3>
              
              <p><strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>  has put in effort to create a catalog of your favorite books and categorized them for ease of access. The cover images & book description are procured from third party/publishers and <strong> My Once Upon A Time </strong>  takes no guarantee of the accuracy of such content. You might receive a book that has a cover different from what was shown online. This is because different publishers of the same book use different cover images. Best efforts have been taken to deliver the goods described on the site; the company takes no guarantee that the book will bear the exact cover produced on the site. The books are subject to availability and the presence of multiple copies of the same book from multiple publishers may result in a disparity between the cover shown on the site, and the book delivered. Despite this, the content of the book would be the same. </p>
